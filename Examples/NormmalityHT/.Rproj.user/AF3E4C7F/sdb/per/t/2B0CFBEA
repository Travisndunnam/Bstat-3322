Slinkman\"\ndate: \"November 9, 2015\"\noutput: word_document\n---\n\nIn this document we will discuss methods to assess the normality of a distribution of data sample.  We will discuss both graphical and hypothesis testing methods and then give guidlines when each should be use.\n\n# Quantiles\nQuantiles are cutpoints dividing a set of observations into equal sized groups. There are one fewer quantiles than the number of groups created. Thus quartiles are the 3 cut points that will divide a dataset into four equal-size groups.  \n\nFor exanple suppose we we have a set of 100 normal random variables where $Y$ is a random variable from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviatiom $\\sigma$.  We write this in short form as:  \n\n$$y \\sim N( \\mu , \\sigma )$$\n\n",
