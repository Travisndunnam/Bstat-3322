In this document we will discuss methods to assess the normality of a distribution of data sample.  We will discuss both graphical and hypothesis testing methods and then give guidlines when each should be use.

# Quantiles
Quantiles are cutpoints dividing a set of observations into equal sized groups. There are one fewer quantiles than the number of groups created. Thus quartiles are the 3 cut points that will divide a dataset into four equal-size groups.  

For exanple suppose we we have a set of 100 normal random variables where $Y$ is a random variable from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviatiom $\sigma$.  We write this in short form as:  

$$y \sim N( \mu , \sigma )$$
