It is possible to read a file over the internet by specifing the location of the file with the url.  The file 

$$http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv$$ 

gives all the earthqukes in the world for the prior 30 daays.

We can read this data into R as follows:
```{r,url}
URL <- 
    "http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv"

Quakes <- read.csv( URL,
                    header=TRUE )
head( Quakes )

hist(  Quakes$mag )

with( Quakes, hist(mag))
with( Quakes, summary(mag))
with( Quakes, sd(mag))
```
